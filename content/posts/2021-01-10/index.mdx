**The hardest challenge** for me with my coding journey has been planning. By planning, I mean preparing my curriculum or track that stay consistent with. While I’ve been trying to tailor the best method for learning, I quickly realize what doesn’t work verses what does. I seem work/learn best, when I cut out all of my other obligations and tasks to ultimately sit down and solely focus on coding. Another thing that keeps me going, is my actual interest in the subject and what I can actively do with it or how I can apply it. Nothing keeps me intrigued (and awake) like web-development. With my Python course, I have given it a good go but I instantly get sleepy or find a distraction due to my lack of focus/interest. However, anything dealing with how something appears on the screen will keep me awake and focused for however long. 

I thought that with thorough planning, I could keep myself on a deadline that will allow me to learn whatever subject, without much interest but my planning seems to go haywire in this department and I don’t really complete any goals with life happening and a unwavering deadline

### Current Problems and Improvement
The fellowship ends on the 19th and since it began I’ve managed to study Python with the plan to make a program that texts me affirmation texts every morning. I’ve signed up for a Hackathon with ValTech and a Voyage with Chingu. With the Hackathon, I wanted to get the gist of what it is, what to do, and poke my head around. I don’t necessarily feel ready to participate, but I am for sure present and seeing what I can gain from it for the future. With the Voyage, I wanted it to gain pair programming experience. 

As far as my work-life, I strongly see the end my part-time job in order to stay home and pursue this full-time again. Ultimately I want to be present and consistent with learning and job prepping/searching. Furthermore, working and coding simultaneously is extremely difficult when energy needs to be applied to both. To focus or even get an hour in a day while having the energy is my biggest challenge.

Taking everything into account, I have made major improvements on understanding not letting emotions control me socially. Knowing that I don’t normally put myself out there, I’m becoming fully aware that I have to be my own recruiter to get myself seen regardless of how I “feel.” Taking action without feeling means that it has to be done no matter what. It is discipline. I don’t personally like this word, I think that the definition or expressions of it resonate with me better (if that makes sense).

### Feelings Recap
My feelings about everything that’s going on have been good in the sense that everything is happening for my greater good. Controlling my emotions and pacing myself realistically but also giving every available minute to my coding goals, has gotten so much better. I’m discovering that when I take breaks from tech, I focus on only two other things that give me entertainment or I can do on the side. This limits my mind and false potential towards things I can’t finish. So for now, it’s Halo and my sticker business.

I now want to show and prove. Updating my social media with my progress only, getting to work, and networking are my sole focus.
