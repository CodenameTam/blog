**It's Official**

I’m going to start this off right by announcing that I’ve officially broken into tech! I’ve managed to get my first tech position as a ‘Junior Web Specialist’. I must say that the initial interviewing and onboarding has went pretty swiftly. Even though I had an interview after accepting the offer there, I preferred to stay put. But here I’m going to go into detail about my tactics of increasing my chances to land a position.

### Interviewing

So I’ve been on the usual roundabout of applying, getting the company’s attention to interview, getting everything prepared, and then sweating through the entire thing not only to get rejected, but to have time wasted from selecting the wrong roles. Also the classic cycle of a recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn with a contract position and an assessment test, and ghosting you, gets old pretty fast. I’ve even had foreign/oversees recruiters urgently ask for the last 4 of my social in order to be submitted for an interview (which I’ve always given them fake ones due to skepticism). So whatever pattern or shape a job search can be, I’ve been through it. Therefore I’ve come up with a few solutions about the process that helped steer any job search in the best direction.

First things first, I had to decide what kind of work I wanted to do which determined what company to go after. Big companies that are eager give you tests and assessments (on javascript) seemed to be something that I didn’t prefer and that I veered away from. I wanted to aim more towards intimate startups due to being a smaller size, a little more intimate, and more collaborative. For bigger companies, there’s of course a team ethic as well but they seemed to be more of a ‘assembly line’ position/role you have to play. My goal is to grow and thrive within a company and it be an investment on both sides.

With all of that being said, I observed what offers were coming my way from the practices I was putting out there. I made sure my LinkedIn, portfolio, GitHub, and social media was up to par, in order to attract and be available to my ideal roles. I noticed that the roles coming from these outlets were not what I wanted so after about 6 interviews of the wrong type of roles, I switched my gears into finding a real person I could talk to. And that was through Indeed and Zip Recruiter. 

With both of these platforms, I knew I had a higher chance of talking to someone who genuinely wanted help and wanted it fast. Therefore, I kept these accounts and leads open to generate more interest. So in the end, I did end up getting my job from Zip Recruiter and as bad as I wanted a good job, I wanted to be the potential employee that the company eagerly wanted.

### The Downfall of the Side Activities

A couple of things had fallen to the wayside including my two Pair Programming projects, investments of ITIL, and my resume service. With adjusting to a new schedule of commuting, kids, household, and staying on top of work tasks, I know my plate will be at its capacity. Also my sticker business will be on cruise control until I can invest more time into that as well. Furthermore, I ended up landing this job without the help of my investment in my resume and ITIL course. I will try my hardest to make use of both, but I’m not sure how realistic that is. So with receiving more insight from my resume investment, I will pursue more of the topic of navigating professionally.

### Final Thoughts

Finding the right formula to land a job can be very tricky given that tech can be so broad but a position can be so specific to even only a few languages. Also just actively and exhaustingly pushing through, can not only improve your interviewing skills, but it will eventually will enable you to become an expert at doing it right. I’m excited about my new role and what I’ve negotiated. Now I have to prepare to move our family to Charlotte where the new adventure will begin.
