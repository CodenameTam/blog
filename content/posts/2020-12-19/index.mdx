excerpt: After ending my manicuring business due to Covid, I gave myself 3 months to dive into coding full-time.

**August 30th** was the day that I ended the lease to my Nail Salon suite and began coding again where I had left off. From old courses that were never finished to new ones that I've never started, I had my studies cut out for me if I wanted to dedicate 3 months to learning code before my bills caught up with my savings.

### Fast forward to today...

Now that it's December and I have acquired a part-time job since then, I had to realize that even though I've learned so much.. I still have far to go. Plus, the tech industry seems so difficult to break into. Overall, for my first post, I wanted to sort of celebrate what I've done and how far I've gotten. 
The resources and communities that I've found are amazing, abundant, and genuinely want to see beginners succeed.

#### My favorite online resoucres:
- Freecodecamp
- Stackoverflow
- Dev.to
- Twitter
- Dice.com

#### My favorite communities:
- Coding Black Females
- Coding Newbies
- Black Tech Pipeline
- Black Tech Twitter
Here I can not only learn how to solve problems, but they all keep me in the loop with what I should learn or what's current.

### As far as my goals that I've managed to achieve:
* I'm a mentee of the Coding Black Females Mentorship program. 
* I've completed my 60hr Web Development Bootcamp
* Created this blog
* Started a Python Course

#### My next steps...

 I'm going to continue to job prep and search. I'm to the point where I think cold emailing would be a great tactic to landing my first position at a small local company, so I'll see how that goes. I will also seek pair programming to get a sense of a real-world experience and I've found with Chingu.
As for my side-projects, I'm planning to revert my Code Journal to a React app and improve functionality on it.
I hope to improve more with React while learning Python as well to help my chances of finding what language I can use best.
