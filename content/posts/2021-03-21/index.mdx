**Planning Habits While Refreshing to Balance**

Since it’s been awhile since my last post, I really wanted to live a little to have a good recap. I’m trying to get a solid enforcement of getting what I want. This month, I've completed my 1st Chingu voyage, the Kong Fellowship, and the Basics of Javascript portion of freecodecamp. I will go more into depth about my specific thoughts of each of them along with my business venture.

### Chingu

Chingu overall taught me immensely about team work, collaborating, and how to do that remotely. I loved learning about the agile methodology being one of the blueprints to get things to run effectively. Generally, I wish certain things about the project were different, but I will make sure to communicate effectively and think of better solutions in my next voyage which I’ll be starting in April.

### The Kong x Coding Black Females Fellowship

I’ve completed the amazing Kong fellowship and with my “best under pressure” work method, I was able to get my presentation, the app demo set up, and everything right just in time to produce and execute the day how I planned (whether at the last minute or not). The demonstration ultimately was similar to public speaking. The same nervousness happened but I had to work through to make sure I kept attention, and didn’t bore people. My mentor has been priceless throughout the entire experience and I think the match-making was perfect. He complimented me on my entire demo and offered his help even after the fellowship. This taught me a lot about what to do with opportunity when I get it. Is to not take advantage over it.

### Java Script

My current challenge is Javascript and has it been for awhile. However, the most effective way thus far is actually working with it and seeing how it works. I’ve completed the JS basics portion in Freecodecamp, and with completing a take-home-test with Es6, I’m halfway through that section. I’ve also completed a Javascript for web designers to honestly focus on the front-end and not go too much in depth on the backend. I am getting more and more familiar with it, which is the goal. But I've come to realize that my discipline has to supersede my interest for me to continue getting the hang of it.

### Being business minded

During my breaks from coding, I’m exercising what I learn about business, and executing it within my sticker business. My ultimate goal is to create a successful online business that I really enjoy doing all of the parts for. By online, I mean strictly through marketing. I think the main challenging things about entrepreneurship are staying motivated, system planning, and actually sticking to that plan. I’d love to push myself to really work for myself and promote like other shameless people do.

#### Recap 

I want to study, apply, and progress in coding, digital art, and business but in a profound way. I do see the beauty in this journey, but at this point, I’m so eager to see some results from my efforts by either getting a job, making my first sale, and truly making something of myself and my time. It can honestly be discouraging if I let it get to me, but I’d rather just keep busy. It’s stimulus time and with it, I only want to invest in my upward mobility. So I will do that.
