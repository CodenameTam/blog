**So with Black History Month and hiring season in full swing,** I’m trying not to get discouraged with my coding progress this year. Even though I’ve been at home full-time and it’s ultimately what I needed, I feel like the mountain to getting a job is much bigger than I realized. I’ve been gearing up for my fellowship Python project, even though I’m no longer continuing the Python Course (due to non-interest). Actually, learning Python has taught me so much about programming as it relates to the fundamentals and Javascript in general. However, it has so many dependencies to get up and running, that I don’t want to dive off of the deep end with it.

Furthermore, with leveraging time, I’ll always feel like there’s never enough to constantly gain skills, tailor for jobs, and interview prep… but I’ll find a way. Also, I do get to pursue my sticker business which keeps my breaks from coding on something lucrative. The good news is I’ve been getting a flood of recruiters contacting me about different roles but the bad news is, I am not confident enough in my Javascript skills with the coding tests to actually solidify a web developer job. As of today, I actually have an untaken coding test sitting in my email now, due to pure intimidation. So back to the basics I go.

### Javascript - Going Back to the Basics
I’ve actually found my most effective learning methods are have different resources simultaneously and when I’m actually coding. I think back to how I got so good at HTML and CSS and it’s with the sole action of tinkering with code to see what it does, not following along and writing things down. If I want to get to the point of knowing JS outside of projects, code it manually, and minimize how much I’m Googling, I will be where I want to be.

### The Voyage - How effort can make or break an entire project
As of today, my two team members have not been that active but we actually collaborated on the project design together with InVision. Also, I had a pair-programming session with a random Chingu member where we helped each other with our coding problems and that was very productive. I’m learning how much communication and organization is vital even for small tasks. I’m ready to spearhead the rest of the team project (even with my lack of manual knowledge for JS) but in reality, I have to work around their lives and effort. For what it’s worth though, I love the overall objectives that the head organizers encourage about the Agile Methodology and team advice. I hope we can make progress, even if it has to be two of us instead of three, because I’d love to have a git flow with others for the first time.

### Interviews - A completely different study
Since I’m going back over JS in FreeCodeCamp, I saw that they had an interviewing section that allows you to practice your skills with tests. I feel amazing to be at this stage, but it also has the importance of any of the other skills needed for the job. From git repos, to LinkedIn Learning, there are plenty of resources for interviewing to dive into. It’s my next step that I’ll have to thoroughly explore.
