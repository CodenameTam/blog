**Raising the Bar**

So with this past month of April, some major things have happened! 2 days after my last post, I applied and got accepted into Collab Lab which is a huge dream come true for me!! In my mind, it’s so valuable to feel apart of something and with me experiencing Chingu, I’ve admired Collab Lab for being more competitive in a sense that if you don’t get selected, you’d have to keep applying and honing in on your skills, in order to get in. Furthermore, to finally be in is my way of proving to myself that I did step up and do what needed to be done when it comes to learning efficiently.

### Collab Lab and Chingu

So the Collab-Lab experience is indeed as welcoming and inviting as I thought it would be. It is also very structured but allows immense room for exploring and asking questions (ie. them offering the blueprint to assignments/issues but that allows you and your partner to figure them out in any you two see fit but also in a way that is cohesive in a team). Since the stack was React and Firebase, I did some initial studying and refreshing on it to really get the hang of it. I even took it upon myself to build my own app simultaneously using them. It’s really helped me lead in some areas of the project while my partner could easily lead in the other areas (especially some of the Javascript).

Both Chingu and Collab-Lab have the beauty of allowing people with differences come together and work seamlessly and contribute with the same goal in mind. Both of them provide extra help with mentors and discussions via Slack or Discord. Both also remind me of college with the aspect that things will be provided for you but it’s up to you to prioritize and utilize them. Granted, with the time devotion towards the project itself, communicating, and life happening, you have to become willed in time management to not let even the mini but priceless opportunities pass you by. So with being apart of both organizations at the same time, I’m going all in with also applying for jobs and investing before May, which is my set deadline to land something. If I don’t meet that deadline, I’ll have to continue my journey working around my kids schedule, which will be super challenging, but not impossible.

### Interviewing 

As far as applying, my interviews have been bittersweet with not enough of what they’re looking for but with super helpful feedback. Rejection is a super mood killer, but even in my mind, I let the interview itself be the superseding celebration. If a company misses out on the right investment, that’s on them. I do know that my value is high, but I’m eager to find a company that undoubtedly knows so as well. I can admit, that I can do more to exercise my skills with online coding tests and really get everything down pact and inline, but I also understand that there is a capacity of time, energy, and effort to get everything done. With that being said, I have begun looking into something more of a “golden ticket” way of getting into tech and that seems to be certifications.

### Investing into ITIL

Even though it is more of the IT part of tech, I eagerly want to start something like now that could make me money, change my family’s lives, and pivot us into a better lifestyle. I’ve purchased an ITIL training course to get started with the exam voucher included and couldn’t be happier. I’m ready to tell my story about my transition and help others with my road blocks.

### Final Thoughts

The reality of becoming a Web Developer undoubtedly involves a formula of devoted time, unique skills, and the right dash of luck to get a job, and with all of that invested, I still have not landed anything. I’m sure someone could offer more research resources for me to add to my studies that require even more time that doesn’t seem to be realistic with my deadline to pursue further, unless I’m granted some type of cushion at this time.
