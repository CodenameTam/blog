## Being away from my hometown again

Since June 15th, I’ve officially moved to Charlotte and yet again, out of my hometown. The goal was new beginnings, a fresh start in life, and a new identity in Queen City. It’s just something about relocating and re-creating yourself, that seems to excite me. FYI, not becoming someone I’m not but living in my truth and making new first impressions. Oh well, even though I was looking forward to moving here, moving itself (basically alone because my bf had military duties), was damn near traumatizing! With deadlines and transferring all the paperwork things, still working, and managing kids, it’s been the milestone to even get settled. Here it is August already and I still don’t feel nearly as settled as I thought. I’m guessing with goals of permanently moving here, I’m not rushing it. With additional money rolling in, new opportunities, along with extra responsibilities. In a nutshell, I’m genuinely happy that I trusted myself enough to make moves towards a career that compensates me well and turned out to be everything that I expected. Let’s get into the real deal about the drastic change in my first 60 days of tech! 

## Housing Market
Even though we expected to purchase a house, the housing market here in Charlotte is very extreme and is not for regular families. But for apartments however, it is very convenient; which is why the transition was so fast and what we had to settle for. My apartment now is my little sanctuary in a new sense that I didn’t want to get comfortable enough to decorate my public-housing apartment back in Winston Salem. The area is nicer and convenient location-wise. Compared to the rest of Charlotte though, it’s just a start. We have amenities like a pool and gate that I’m not used to and I’m super grateful. I’m most excited about investing in my new place including my tech/office area.
With moving overall, I juggled moving my kids, finding them daycare (a continuous struggle), along with packing and preparing to vacate the old apartment. In this extreme time, I could see who I could rely on and who I couldn’t. That also determined whether to further nurture relationships while I’m on my path to fulfilled living. 

## Success, aspirations, and loneliness
Something I realized for having aspirations for upward mobility, it separates me from many people. Given that I went I incognito from social media, it was my biggest inspiration to break into tech because of exposure to relatable women living luxurious lives with tech positions. However I found that sometimes, upward mobility in life and career will not only separate you, but isolate you. I feel as though I will be amongst the women in tech who end up fulfilling their goals and aspirations of traveling and indulging in luxurious activities alone, with immediate family, or very few. I’m completely fine knowing that I can’t want more for others than they want for themselves. Therefore, deciding to offer conditional help is all that I can do; with the only condition being helping will actually help, not hinder. 

## First 60 days at work
The first 3 months of my career have been a complete whirlwind. Initially, I’ve met new people, tried fresh places to eat and shop. Now, I’m experiencing newfound “work stress.” This creates an additional challenge of balancing personal and professional goals. My biggest issue is commuting daily with all of my tech belongings just to continue to sit at a computer. Also, being a Web Developer lends itself to working far beyond the average 40hours weekly. So I dedicate my spare time to beauty regimens, parenting, and my relationship. 
I’ve noted some slight disadvantages within management, but they don’t certainly don’t outweigh the outstanding qualities of the agency. I’m able to express myself amongst other people who are all different. Overall, I really like the agency for its trajectory and I don’t think that I would feel comfortable leaving until I’ve exhausted all of my advantages, which should hold me for a while. I know people compartmentalize being business-minded, not owing the company anything, and moving on, but I seek to pay my dues for an agency that gave me my first shot in tech.

## Final Thoughts
I will continue to be honest in my skill level and my workload in order to manage work/home life. As far as being social, I don’t really care to keep many connections to my hometown and I’d like to cherish new and genuine ones, whether virtually or locally now. I’ll continue to connect with like-minded, inspirational people to avoid being drained. I want to continue my skill-sets in all things tech and art. I owed it to my little blog here to carve out time and consistently commit. I hope you’ve enjoyed this work/life update!
