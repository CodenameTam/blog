# My Blog about my Coding Journey

Created with Netlify, Gatsby, and GitLab, I not only wanted to have a space where I document my journey but also to document the many resources that I've came across, on one page.
I hope to find a formula of projects, portfolio and interviews to land my first tech position!

## How I hope to improve this blog

I hope that I can adjust certain things about this starter theme to make it my own and safely customize it without breaking the code.
